## Project Overview

Welcome to the Detection and Emergence of Complexity workshop website, a workshop dedicated to exploring the intricate and fascinating world of complexity science. This website serves as a hub for our annual conference, bringing together leading experts, researchers, and enthusiasts to discuss the latest advancements and applications in the field. From cellular automata to artificial life, our program is designed to inspire and engage participants with cutting-edge talks, workshops, and panel discussions.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
