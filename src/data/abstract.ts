  An abundance of systems has been studied as potential models of artificial life: from classical discrete cellular automata, to their randomized versions such as random Boolean networks, continuous systems including neural CAs or Lenia systems, or even simple programming languages.

  In this workshop, we would like to focus on the fundamental question of how to measure the complexity of such systems and detect emerging patterns within them. The conference will be held at EPFL Bernoulli Center, featuring keynote speeches, panel discussions, and interactive sessions.
